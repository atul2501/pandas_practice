<p style="color: white">The next Canadian federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025,<br/></p>
<p style="color: white">As per Canada's fixed election date legislation, which mandates elections every four years on the third Monday of October.</p>

<p style="color: white">In Canada, the federal government and all provinces and territories have enacted legislation setting election dates, usually every four years, one year sooner than the constitutionally set five year maximum life of a parliament. </p>
<p style="color: white">However, the governor general, lieutenant governors, and commissioners still have the legal power to call a general election on the advice of the relevant first minister at any point before the fixed date.</p>
<p style="color: white"> By-elections, used to fill vacancies in a legislature, are also not affected by fixed election dates.</p>




<p style="color: white">However, recent political developments may lead to an earlier election.</p>
<p style="color: white">Following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation announcement in January 2025, the Liberal Party held a leadership election on March 9, 2025, resulting in Mark Carney becoming the new leader.</p>

<p style="color: white">Carney's leadership is expected to influence the timing of the next federal election, potentially advancing it to April 28 or May 5, 2025.</p>

<p style="color: white">Therefore, while the fixed date is October 20, 2025, the upcoming federal election may occur earlier, depending on political developments and decisions by the new Liberal leadership.</p>

<p style="color: white">Canada’s incoming prime minister, Mark Carney, has met with Justin Trudeau as the pair discuss a transfer of power after the former central banker’s landslide victory at the Liberal party’s leadership race.</p>

<p style="color: white">The meeting on Monday sets the stage for an imminent federal election and gives Canada a fresh leader to square off against the United States president, with the two countries locked in a bitter trade war provoked by Donald Trump.</p>

<p style="color: white">Briefly speaking to reporters, Carney said he was “honoured” to receive nearly 86% of the vote, one of the most decisive wins of a party leader in decades.

But, the 59-year-old former banker said he had “a lot of wood to chop” as he prepares to assume the reins of a country tearing on the verge of economic calamity.</p>
